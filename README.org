* Introduction
  
  use QT as Golang program frontend, QT only draws UI, data is processed by backend program powered by Golang

* Software Requirements

  Here is a list of the softwares we use in this demo:

+ Lua 5.2.3
+ QT 5.3.2
+ Go 1.3.3

This demo is tested under ubuntu12.04 i386 and Windows XP SP3

* How to build

** linux

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd /path/to/this/demo
  go build *.go                   # build Golang backend program 
  qmake && make                   # build QT frontend program
  ./ipc_demo                      # run
#+END_SRC

** windows

*** build frontend

    you'd better build this demo in QtCreator if you use Windows operation system

    QtCreator will generate *ipc_demo.exe*

*** build backend

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # open a cmd shell
  cd /the/path/to/this/demo
  go build backend.go  protocol.go # will generate *backend.exe*
#+END_SRC

*** put all together

    Here is the files list:
    
+ ipc_demo.exe
+ backend.exe
+ cryingJingChou.png
+ config.lua
+ lua52.dll

lua52.dll is in subdirectory named *lua-5.2.3*
